# Credits-Generator
Use the command line to create HTML page to properly credit the members of your team.

# Description

Going one step further than creating a markdown file, this time we 
are creating a web page.  This time we are asking a user to enter in a team of people led by one manager to show off their information like their id and emails.  The emails have links so you can email the members individually!  This project takes a deeper look into inquirer and uses recursion, conditionals, and nested then loops.  Working through this project taught me alot about the ins and out of inquirer.  The default inquirer documentation is not that useful, so I had to scour the internet to find out what is really going on.  It taught me to look for 3rd party resources and read deeply into how the code work.  It also taught me about asych and await and promises as I had a scare where I would send the data to the file creator before all the inputs were sent.

This generator was made to help people painlessly create a html page to credit their team.  It also bridges back my experience in the frontend back to into a complete package.  This project is effectively a one way call from backend to frontend as the 'server' passes it in the front end and populates the html elements there.
